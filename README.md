# POAS
First-Draft;​ ​National​ ​Cryptocurrencies​ ​issued​ ​by​ ​legitimate​ ​authority through​ ​proof-of-authoritative-state​ ​consensus​ ​(​ ​POAS​ ​). 

# 1.​ ​Introduction

Apart from issues addressed in scalability, Bitcoin faces significant resistance for mass adoption as a national currency of a country. High volatility, centralization risk, and the government’s preference to exercise control over currency build barriers for Bitcoin to replace existing alternatives. Cryptocurrency advantages are sound and difficult to ignore. Although, presence of skepticism in Bitcoin adoption, national cryptocurrency initiatives under supervised control are inevitable. A supervised setting, similar​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Bitcoin​ ​network,​ ​would​ ​replicate​ ​cryptocurrency​ ​at​ ​a​ ​lower​ ​national​ ​scale. We propose a permissioned decentralized network, to ease transition towards mass adoption of national cryptocurrency based on proof-of-authoritative-state consensus.

# 2.​ ​​ ​​Proof-of-Authoritative-State​ ​Consensus​ ​(​ ​POAS​ ​)

Proof-of-authoritative-state (POAS) consensus is a slight variation of proof-of-authority consensus. POAS ensures concatenation of blocks to the genesis chain by an authoritative entity. Eligible authoritative entities are mainly the state governments, referred to as an authoritative state. India, one of the largest democracy in the world could be further subdivided into twenty-eight such authoritative states. Each authoritative state holds the responsibility to validate transactions within every new concatenated block and maintain the correctness of the genesis chain. Such a permissioned ledger system operated through authoritative states enable higher scalability,​ ​better​ ​security,​ ​and​ ​a​ ​form​ ​of​ ​decentralization.

## 3.​ ​​ ​​Transition​ ​from​ ​Fiat​ ​to​ ​Coins

The central authority limits the total supply of coins within the genesis block. The genesis block is finalized by reserving a proportionate amount of fiat currency. Initial value of the coins can be derived from the total limited supply and amount of initial fiat currency reserved. After the genesis block is successfully finalized, the authoritative states are eligible to concatenate new blocks to the genesis chain adhering to the proof-of-authoritative-state consensus. A central authority merely holds responsibility for creation of the genesis block. Further concatenation of blocks to the genesis chain by authoritative states, strengthens any form of alteration to the genesis block. Each authoritative state receives newly minted coins from the total supply as reward along with​ ​the​ ​transaction​ ​tax​ ​of​ ​every​ ​transaction​ ​included​ ​in​ ​the​ ​block. 
  
  Authoritative states redistribute the obtained reward coins to their local authoritative entities, such as commercial banks. Banks buy coins for fiat currency from the authoritative states. Authoritative states further supply their earnings to the initial reserve pool. Banks redistribute the coins to citizens for higher fiat. Citizens transact peer-to-peer using the genesis chain maintained by the set of authoritative states. Assuming soundness in the advantages, cryptocurrency provides, citizens would resort to cryptocurrency by exchanging their fiat with banks. Fiat currency would flow from banks to authoritative state, from authoritative state to the initial reserve. Value of the coin​ ​appreciates​ ​with​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​flow​ ​of​ ​fiat​ ​currency​ ​to​ ​the​ ​initial​ ​reserve. 

## 4.​ ​​ ​Transaction​ ​Tax 

Transaction tax is the cost associated with settlement of a transaction.Transaction tax vary depending on the type of transaction ie. heavy tax can be issued on zero-knowledge transactions. Each authoritative state is entitled for all the transaction tax​ ​generated​ ​from​ ​inbound​ ​and​ ​outbound​ ​transaction. 

## 5.​ ​Auditable​ ​Encrypted​ ​Access

  Tax agencies of each state hold encrypted access for monitoring the genesis chain. Auditable genesis chain ease tax enforcement and identification of malicious transactions, such as illegal trade, monetary corruption, etc. Distribution of audit responsibility across tax agencies allow much fairer and decentralized audit of a national currency​ ​flow. 

## 6.​ ​​ ​Conclusion 

  Above decentralized system provides a way for a country to transition from fiat to national cryptocurrency. Adjustment of low-level parameters of the consensus mechanism can be sanctioned by a particular country to serve different policies. A permissioned distributed ledger promotes to maintain a balance between the transparency​ ​of​ ​economic​ ​activities​ ​and​ ​privacy​ ​of​ ​the​ ​citizens.
